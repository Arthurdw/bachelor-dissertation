% \itodo{Write the experiment}
% In this part of your bachelor's dissertation, you describe your experiment. Or put another way, how did you gain knowledge to give your TEDTalk/final presentation.
% This is the body of your report, where you make the difference compared to existing literature. Also make sure it is clear what you have made/added compared to existing material.
% Make sure the following issues are covered throughout the different chapters:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item the methodology
%     \item justified choices of technology/software/procedure etc.,
%     \item results,
%     \item critical analysis of the results.
% \end{itemize}
% The above items are not literal chapters but should be interwoven throughout the body of your documentation report.
% Make sufficient use of figures and visualisations (do not forget citations). Make sure you have a nice coherent whole, with clear structure and a smooth readability. Don't be afraid to use AI tools for this. Do not forget to include your AI prompts at the back of this report.
% Too many details that would distract from the story of your bachelor's dissertation should be relegated to an appendix. (E.g. installation procedure, pieces of code.)
