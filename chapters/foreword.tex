\tocchapter{Foreword}

\itodo{write the foreword}

The foreword contains the usual thanks. All those who helped with the final paper are thanked.
The persons who made the most significant contribution are thanked first. Write the name, position and title of persons correctly.
Indicate your name, place and date at the bottom (optional). A signature is not appropriate here.
Because the word in advance is strongly personal, it is often written in the I form.
