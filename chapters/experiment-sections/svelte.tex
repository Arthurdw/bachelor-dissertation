\label{sec:svelte}

\subsection{Overview}
\label{subsec:svelte:overview}

Svelte, created by Rich Harris and maintained by the open source community with support from Vercel \cite{vercel:welcomes_rich}, distinguishes itself by being compiled, fast, and quick to write, eliminating the need for boilerplate code. It confines its components within a custom file type that is easily readable and understandable without requiring prior knowledge. This file type is then compiled into \acrshort{js}, \acrshort{html}, and \acrshort{css}, ensuring efficient and optimized performance.

Unlike many other frameworks, Svelte does not use the \acrshort{vdom}, avoiding the associated downsides. It boasts a significant adoption rate, including usage in enterprise environments, and has developed a large and vibrant ecosystem. Svelte automatically scopes styles, simplifying the management of component-specific styles and reducing the likelihood of style conflicts.

Svelte's popularity is reflected in its acclaim, having been voted the most loved and admired \acrshort{js} framework in the Stack Overflow survey \cite{stackoverflow:survey_2023}. In addition to its technical advantages, Svelte provides an in-depth interactive walkthrough and excellent documentation, making it accessible for developers of all skill levels and facilitating a smoother learning curve.
